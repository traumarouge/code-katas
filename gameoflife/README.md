# Game of life

## Description
The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), invented by mathematician John Conway, is a cellular automaton, i.e. a system in which a set of rules is applied to cells and their neighbors in a regular grid. The universe of the Conway's Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either alive (populated) or dead (unpopulated). Any cell interacts with its eight neighbours: the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. Applying a set of rules to the cells in a given generation produces a new generation.

## Rules
* a living cell with fewer than two living neighbours dies
* a living cell with more than three living neighbours dies
* a living cell with two or three living neighbours stays alive
* a dead cell with three living neighbours becomes a living cell
